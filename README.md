# Credit-risk-analytics
Derive insights with the help of exploratory data analysis of previous credit history

his case study aims to give an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario and develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services to understand how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

Objective is to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their credits which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

The insights help the bank to focus on smart disposal of loans.
